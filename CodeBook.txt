This project was based on Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities 
of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

It includes two main data sets:

1. HAR Data Set:  It was created merging the training and test with information provided for and the structure is as follows:

1.1. Variables:
1.1.1. Subject:  Identifies the each subject who performed the activity for each sample. 
Range: 1 to 30

1.1.2. Mean and Standard Deviation for the features selected in the original data.  
In this case the data come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ 
floating-point values, normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

1.1.3.  Activity: Identifies the activity the subject is doing.  It has six possible values:
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

1.2. Transformations 
1.2.1. Merge data of training and test in one data set
1.2.2. Extract only Subject, Activity, Mean and Standard Deviation data
1.2.3. The Activity column was replaced by the label
1.2.4. Change the variable names to descriptive names


2. HAR_means.txt:  It was created based on HAR but including all means for each variable grouped by Subject and Activity

2.1. Variables

2.1.1. Subject:  Identifies the each subject who performed the activity for each sample. 
Range: 1 to 30

2.1.2.  Activity: Identifies the activity the subject is doing.  It has six possible values:
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

2.1.3. Mean Values for the Variables:  The means were calculated grouping by Subject and Activity

floating-point values, normalised and bounded within [-1,1].
